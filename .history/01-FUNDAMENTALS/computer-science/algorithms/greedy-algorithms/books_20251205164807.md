## INTERMEDIATE

### Algorithms (Sedgewick & Wayne) – Greedy Examples
Author: Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne
Year: 2011
Publisher: Addison-Wesley
Link: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/
Description: Implementations and visualizations of greedy algorithms (e.g., interval scheduling, MST-related greedy examples) with empirical insights.
Why included: Good bridge from theory to implementation; includes visual aids that help intuition.

## ADVANCED

### Matroid Theory and Combinatorial Optimization (selected chapters)
Author: Various (survey chapters)
Description: Advanced resources that connect greedy algorithms to matroid theory and characterize when greedy approaches are optimal.
Why included: Provides the theoretical framework (matroids) explaining the correctness of greedy approaches on broad problem classes.

### Algorithmic Game Theory / Optimization texts (Greedy in approximation algorithms)
Author: Varied
Description: Advanced chapters discussing greedy heuristics, approximation bounds, and proofs of (in)approximability.
Why included: Important for understanding limits of greedy strategies and designing approximation guarantees.

---

## CLASSIC

### Matroid theory foundations
Author: Jack Edmonds (and subsequent work)
Description: Seminal work linking matroids and greedy algorithms, establishing formal conditions when the greedy method yields optimal solutions.
Why included: Fundamental theoretical foundation for generalizing greedy correctness beyond ad-hoc proofs.
