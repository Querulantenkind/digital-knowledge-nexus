## TOOLS

### VisuAlgo (visualization)
Link: https://visualgo.net/
Description: Visual algorithm explorer useful for stepwise demonstration of greedy strategies.
Why included: Makes greedy choices visible and helps debug algorithmic intuition.

### algorithms-visualizer (open-source)
Link: https://github.com/algorithms-visualizer/algorithms-visualizer
Description: Open-source visualizer for many algorithms including greedy examples and simulations.
Why included: Runnable examples and an extensible codebase for teaching and demos.

### NetworkX / Python libraries
