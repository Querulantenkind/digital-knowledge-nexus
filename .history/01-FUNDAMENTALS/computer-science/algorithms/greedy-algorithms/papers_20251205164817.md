## BEGINNER

### A gentle introduction to greedy algorithms (survey/tutorial)
Author: Educational survey authors
Year: 2010s
Platform: Educational surveys/tutorials
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm
Description: Accessible overview of greedy strategies, common examples, and simple correctness arguments.
Why included: Quick orientation for newcomers and a hub for references to canonical papers and examples.

## INTERMEDIATE

### Papers on interval scheduling and activity selection
Author: Various (classic algorithm papers and notes)
Description: Problem-specific papers and lecture notes describing greedy solutions and correctness proofs for activity selection, scheduling, and Huffman coding.
Why included: Demonstrates concrete problem classes where greedy is optimal and offers techniques for standard proofs.

---

## ADVANCED

### Greedy algorithms and matroids (foundational papers and surveys)
Author: Jack Edmonds and subsequent researchers
Description: Research establishing matroid conditions under which greedy selection yields optimal solutions; includes proofs and generalizations.
Why included: Theoretical backbone explaining why greedy works in many combinatorial optimization settings.

---

## CLASSIC

### Seminal Works on Greedy Methods
Author: Historical papers by Edmonds and others
Description: Foundational results linking matroid theory and greedy optimality; includes early MST papers (Kruskal, Prim) as canonical greedy successes.
Why included: Historical and theoretical significance; instructive canonical examples used across curricula.
