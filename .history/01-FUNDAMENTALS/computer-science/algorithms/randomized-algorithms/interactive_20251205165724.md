## BEGINNER

### Quicksort visualizers and randomized simulation notebooks

[Quicksort visualizers](https://visualgo.net/) and assorted Jupyter notebooks

Description: Step-through visualizations for randomized quicksort and small Monte Carlo experiments that reveal average-case behaviour.

Why included: Interactive demonstrations make probabilistic effects and pivot-choice outcomes tangible for learners.

### Randomized hashing playgrounds

[Online hashing playgrounds](https://replit.com/) and interactive demos

Description: Tools to experiment with randomized hashing, collision probability, and fingerprinting techniques.

Why included: Practical, hands-on experiments help learners understand trade-offs in hashing choices.

---

## INTERMEDIATE

### Monte Carlo simulation notebooks and interactive samplers

Description: Notebooks demonstrating randomized rounding, importance sampling, and empirical verification of concentration bounds.

Why included: Empirical verification complements theoretical analysis and builds intuition about variance and tail bounds.

---

## ADVANCED

### Streaming/sketching demos and interactive sketch libraries

Description: Interactive demos of Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog, and related sketches to observe error distributions and parameter trade-offs.

Why included: Practical exposure to sublinear randomized techniques used in large-scale data systems.
