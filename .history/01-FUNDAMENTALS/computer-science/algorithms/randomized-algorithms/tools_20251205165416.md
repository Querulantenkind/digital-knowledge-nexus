## TOOLS

### Random number libraries and reproducible RNGs
Description: Libraries and APIs for high-quality pseudorandom generators (PCG, xoshiro) and tools for reproducible experiments.
Why included: Correct RNG choice and seeding are essential for repeatable randomized algorithm experiments.

### Probabilistic data structure libraries (CountMin, HyperLogLog)
Description: Implementations in multiple languages for randomized sketches and streaming summaries.
Why included: Useful building blocks for randomized streaming and sublinear algorithms.

### Simulation and statistical libraries (NumPy, SciPy, R)
Description: Tools to run Monte Carlo experiments and validate algorithmic behavior empirically.
Why included: Empirical verification complements theoretical analysis for randomized methods.
