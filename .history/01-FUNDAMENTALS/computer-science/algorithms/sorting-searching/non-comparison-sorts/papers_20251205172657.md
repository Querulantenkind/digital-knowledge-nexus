## BEGINNER

### Sorting and comparison lower bounds (survey/introductory papers)
Author: Various survey authors
Description: Accessible papers explaining why comparison-based sorts cannot do better than O(n log n) and how non-comparison sorts avoid this bound.
Why included: Clear motivation for studying non-comparison techniques.

---

## INTERMEDIATE

### Counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort foundational papers
Author: Classic algorithm papers and textbook treatments
Description: Papers describing the algorithms, their correctness, and complexity analysis.
Why included: Understanding core non-comparison sorting techniques.

### External sorting and distribution sorts
Author: Algorithm researchers
Description: Research on adapting non-comparison sorts to external memory and distributed settings.
Why included: Practical applications to large-scale data.

---

## ADVANCED

### Parallel and vectorized sorting
Author: Various (modern systems and algorithm papers)
Year: 2010s-2020s
Description: Research on exploiting parallelism and SIMD for non-comparison sorting.
Why included: Contemporary techniques for high-performance sorting.

---

## CLASSIC

### Early sorting papers and computational complexity foundations
Description: Seminal works establishing sorting lower bounds and early non-comparison algorithms.
Why included: Historical context and theoretical underpinnings.
