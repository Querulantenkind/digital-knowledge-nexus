## BEGINNER

### Valgrind
Creator: Julian Seward, others
Year: 2002-Present
License: GPL v2
Platform: Linux/Unix (with macOS support)
Link: https://www.valgrind.org/
Language: C
Description: Memory debugging and profiling tool; detects leaks, improper allocations, and use-after-free errors. Includes Memcheck (leak detection), Massif (heap profiling), and Helgrind (thread debugging).
Why included: Industry standard for C/C++ memory debugging; free and authoritative.

### AddressSanitizer (ASan)
Creator: Google (Konstantin Serebryany, others)
Year: 2011-Present
License: Apache 2.0
Platform: GCC, Clang (Linux, Windows, macOS)
Link: https://github.com/google/sanitizers
Language: LLVM-based
Description: Compiler-integrated memory error detector catching heap/stack overflows, use-after-free, and leaks at runtime.
Why included: Modern, performant alternative to Valgrind; built into modern compilers.

## INTERMEDIATE

### jemalloc
Creator: Jason Evans (Facebook)
Year: 2005-Present
License: BSD
Platform: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD)
Link: http://jemalloc.net/
Language: C
Description: High-performance drop-in malloc replacement with better multi-threaded scaling, fragmentation reduction, and profiling capabilities.
Why included: Powers many high-performance systems; demonstrates practical memory allocator design.

### Clang Memory Sanitizer
Creator: LLVM Project
Year: 2012-Present
License: Apache 2.0 with LLVM Exception
Platform: LLVM/Clang-based systems
Link: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html
Language: LLVM IR
Description: Detects use of uninitialized memory in programs, complementing AddressSanitizer.
Why included: Catches subtle memory bugs; integrated into modern development workflows.

## ADVANCED

### HeapTrack
Creator: Milian Wolff
Year: 2014-Present
License: LGPL v2+
Platform: Linux
Link: https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack
Language: C++
Description: Detailed heap profiler showing memory allocations over time, peak usage, and allocation patterns.
Why included: Sophisticated profiling for optimizing memory-intensive applications.

### Tracy Profiler
Creator: Bartosz Taudul
Year: 2016-Present
License: BSD
Platform: Cross-platform with Windows/Linux focus
Link: https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy
Language: C++
Description: Real-time CPU profiler with memory tracking, showing allocation timeline and memory hierarchy interactions.
Why included: Modern profiling tool for understanding both CPU and memory performance together.

## RECENT (2023+)

### Miri (Rust Memory Model Checker)
Creator: Rust Project
Year: 2016-Present (2023+ major improvements)
License: MIT + Apache 2.0
Platform: Rust projects (via rustup)
Link: https://github.com/rust-lang/miri
Language: Rust
Description: Experimental interpreter for Rust that detects undefined behavior in code, enforcing memory safety guarantees.
Why included: Novel approach to memory safety verification; enables static checking of ownership rules.

### Dr. Memory
Creator: Derek Bruening (Google/CMU)
Year: 2008-Present
License: LGPL v2
Platform: Windows, Linux
Link: https://drmemory.org/
Language: C/C++
Description: Memory debugging tool similar to Valgrind but with Windows support; detects errors and memory leaks.
Why included: Extended platform support for memory debugging tools.
