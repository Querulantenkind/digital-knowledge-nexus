## Evaluation by Resource Type

### Books

**High Quality Indicators:**
- Published by reputable technical publisher (O'Reilly, MIT Press, Addison-Wesley, etc.)
- Written by recognized experts or practitioners
- Multiple editions indicate lasting relevance
- Widely adopted in courses or industry
- Comprehensive coverage with exercises/examples
- Updated regularly (for living topics)

**Red Flags:**
- Purely promotional content
- No technical depth
- Outdated information presented as current
- Errors or misleading information
- No publisher or self-published without credentials
- Marketing-speak over technical content

**Examples:**

**GOOD:**
```

Year: 1996
Publisher: MIT Press
ISBN: 978-0262510871
Why: Classic CS fundamentals text, used in MIT curriculum for decades, 
introduces programming through Scheme with deep conceptual focus
```

**BAD:**
```

- What does this provide that others don't?
- Is there a better resource on this topic?
- Does it complement or duplicate existing entries?

**2. Quality:**
- Would I recommend this to a colleague?
- Is this from a trustworthy source?
- Is the information accurate and up-to-date?

**3. Accessibility:**
- Can others actually use this?
- Is it clear and well-presented?
- Are prerequisites reasonable?

**4. Longevity:**
- Will this be useful in 2+ years?
- Is it tied to temporary trends?
- Does it teach principles or just tools?

## Special Considerations

### Historical Resources
- May include outdated information if historically significant
- Clearly mark as CLASSIC
- Note contemporary alternatives if needed

### Language-Specific
- English descriptions required
- Non-English resources acceptable if high quality
- Note language in description

### Paywalled Content
- Include if widely recognized as essential
- Note free alternatives when available
- Provide preprint links for papers

### Controversial or Alternative Views
- Include if technically sound and adds perspective
- Note controversial nature if needed
- Balance with mainstream views

---

## When in Doubt

**Ask:**
1. Would a university course assign this?
2. Would a professional recommend this?
3. Does this teach lasting principles?
4. Is the source credible?
5. Is this the best available resource on this topic?

**If yes to most questions → probably include**
**If no to most questions → probably reject**

## Examples of Borderline Cases

### ACCEPT:
- Self-published book by recognized expert
- Blog series that became definitive reference
- Tool from unknown creator that became standard
- Older resource that's still the best available

### REJECT:
- Popular but technically weak resource
- Well-produced but superficial course
- Recent paper with interesting ideas but flawed methodology
- Tool that's popular but better alternatives exist
