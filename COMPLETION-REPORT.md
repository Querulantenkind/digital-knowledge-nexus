## 🎓 Pedagogical Innovation

This structure enables **multiple learning paths**:

### Path 1: Video-First Learner
Veritasium → Crash Course → CMU Lectures → Interactive Tools

### Path 2: Book Learner
Sipser (beginner) → Arora-Barak (intermediate) → Papers (advanced)

### Path 3: Theory Purist
Cook's paper → Karp's paper → ECCC preprints → Research blogs

### Path 4: Practical Engineer
Tool documentation → Algorithm visualizers → Complexity Zoo → ArXiv

### Path 5: Immersive Learner
Full-semester course (MIT) + textbook + problem sets + seminars

**No single "right way"** — each learner finds their path.
